lead: I have always been curious about building a machine-learning startup. Yet, I know nothing about machine learning, and little about startups.

Several things have piqued my interest of late: Startups, machine-learning, Options trading and Kizomba. I just love Kizomba. Machine learning I see as, finally, the means to trully leverage computing to do what I could never do (Or didn't have the time or patience to follow through). Something I can delegate actions to with some certainty that, yeah, it'll get things done, make the necessary decisions and create some value for me. With the bonus of being introduced to options-trading, a field full of esoteric knowledge, quick thinking and analysis, I think it'd be a lot of fun to apply machine-learning to this domain. So this is me: Learning Machine-Learning to make some loot.
